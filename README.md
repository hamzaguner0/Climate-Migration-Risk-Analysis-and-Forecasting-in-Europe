# Climate Migration Risk Analysis and Forecasting in Europe

## Description
This project utilizes data from the Copernicus ERA5 dataset to analyze temperature trends and their potential impacts on climate migration in Europe. By using Python libraries such as `cdsapi` and `xarray`, the project extracts, processes, and analyzes data to visualize temperature changes and identify risk zones for future migration caused by climate factors.

## Objectives
- Process ERA5 temperature data for European regions.
- Create visualizations to map temperature trends.
- Forecast potential migration risks due to extreme climate conditions.
- Provide insights into sustainable development and urban planning in the context of climate change.

## Status
This project is under development. Current progress includes:
- Successful integration of the CDS API for data retrieval.
- Initial processing of NetCDF data.
- Planned implementation of advanced visualizations and predictive models.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** cdsapi, xarray, matplotlib, netCDF4
- **Data Source:** Copernicus ERA5 Dataset

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install cdsapi xarray matplotlib netCDF4

Run the script to retrieve and process data:
python main.py

Visualize results using tools like Matplotlib.
